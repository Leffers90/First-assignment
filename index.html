       <ul>
         <li><strong>1897</strong> He was born in the village of Hội Khánh, in Vạn Ninh District of Khánh Hòa Province in central Vietnam.</li>
         <li><strong>1904</strong> He left to study Buddhism under Hòa thượng Thích Hoằng Thâm.</li>
         <li><strong>1912</strong> Age 15, he took the samanera (novice) vows.</li>
         <li><strong>1917</strong> Ordained as a monk at age 20 under the dharma name Thích Quảng Đức.</li>
         <li><strong>1917</strong> Traveled to a mountain near Ninh Hòa, vowing to live the life of a solitary Buddhism-practicing hermit for three years.</li>
         <li><strong>1920</strong> Began to travel around central Vietnam expounding the dharma.</li>
         <li><strong>1922</strong> Went into retreat at the Sac Tu Thien An pagoda near Nha Trang.</li>
         <li><strong>1932</strong> Appointed an inspector for the Buddhist Association in Ninh Hòa before becoming the inspector of monks in his home province of Khánh Hòa. During this period in central Vietnam, he was responsible for the construction of 14 temples.</li>
         <li><strong>1934</strong> Moved to southern Vietnam and traveled throughout the provinces spreading Buddhist teachings. He spent many years in southern Vietnam overseeing the construction of many temples.</li>
         <li><strong>1963</strong> Self immolation- Đức calmly sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Đức's head. Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words Nam mô A Di Đà Phật ("Homage to Amitābha Buddha") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.</li>

  <p class="mb-0">"I was to see that sight again, but once was enough. Flames were coming from a human being; his body was slowly withering and shriveling up, his head blackening and charring. In the air was the smell of burning human flesh; human beings burn surprisingly quickly. Behind me I could hear the sobbing of the Vietnamese who were now gathering. I was too shocked to cry, too confused to take notes or ask questions, too bewildered to even think ... As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him."</p>
